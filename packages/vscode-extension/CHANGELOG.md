## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Skill tree popup redesigned as a centered modal with dark blurred overlay instead of floating positional popup
  - Phase color accent bar at top of card
  - Stat boxes for Level, Uses, and Tools count
  - Full capabilities list and tools display
  - Spring scale-in animation with heavy drop shadow
- Inventory modal overlay improved — `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` for strong contrast in both themes
- Both modals now share the same visual pattern: dark blurred backdrop, centered card, spring animation

### Fixed

- Modal overlays now properly visible in light mode

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Inventory modal now has a visible dark backdrop with blur — was invisible in light mode because `board-dark/80` resolved to near-white
- Skill tree popup repositioned to appear centered below the clicked node instead of floating far off to the side
- Close button (✕) in skill tree popup now renders as the actual character instead of literal `\u2715` text
- Modal backdrop uses `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` — works in both dark and light themes
- Added drop shadow to modal content for better visual separation

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Theme toggle now actually switches between dark and light mode — CSS selectors were not matching the `data-theme` attribute with enough specificity; changed to `body[data-theme="light"]` to properly override variables

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Skill Tree popup card** — clicking a skill now shows a floating popup next to the node (Diablo/WoW talent tree style) instead of a bottom panel that ate screen space
  - Popup appears to the right of the clicked node, or left if near the edge
  - Shows name, phase, rarity, version, description, level, usage count, capabilities, tools, and Record/Open buttons
  - Click outside or ✕ to dismiss
  - Spring animation on open/close
- **Light mode is now a white whiteboard** (`#ffffff`) instead of cream — clean, minimal, no dust or glow effects
- Dark mode stays black chalkboard (`#0d0f14`)

### Removed
- Bottom detail panel in Skill Tree (replaced by floating popup)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** — sun/moon button in the top nav bar
  - Dark mode: black chalkboard (`#0d0f14`) with dashed chalk borders, dust texture, text glow
  - Light mode: cream whiteboard (`#f5f0e8`) with solid marker-style borders, dark text, no glow
  - Theme persisted in VS Code global state (survives restarts)
  - Smooth 0.3s transition when switching
- **"+ Create Skill" button** on Dashboard — triggers the interactive skill scaffold wizard
- All colors now use CSS custom properties (`var(--board)`, `var(--chalk)`, etc.) for theme-awareness
- `create:skill` and `theme:changed` webview message types

### Changed
- Default background changed from green chalkboard to black chalkboard in dark mode
- Tailwind color tokens now reference CSS variables instead of hardcoded hex values
- HTML template passes saved theme via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` and `<body>`
- Light mode uses solid borders and removes chalk text-shadow/glow effects for a clean whiteboard feel

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-20

  - Dark green board backgrounds (`#1a2f28`) replace pure black surfaces

- Skill tree detail panel: capped height with scroll, shows all capabilities

### Added

- `scroll-fade` CSS utility for gradient-masked scroll containers
- `chalk-text`, `chalk-heading`, `chalk-border`, `chalk-dust` CSS utility classes
- Achievement badges grouped by category with section headers
- Chalkboard color tokens in Tailwind: `board`, `board-light`, `board-dark`, `chalk-dim`, `chalk-yellow`, `chalk-pink`, `chalk-blue`, `chalk-green`

### Fixed
- Achievement notification hidden behind level-up overlay (now sequenced with `defer` prop)
- Skill tree "locked" label inconsistent with inventory "Undiscovered" (unified to "undiscovered")
